# The OpenTracing Specification repository

OpenTracing Specification Official Website: [http://opentracing.io/spec](http://opentracing.io/spec).

The github.com/opentracing/specification repository is a place to document (and discuss) the OpenTracing specification itself (independent of any particular language or platform).

Historically this activity took place on the docs repo ((github.com/opentracing/opentracing.io)[https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing.io]), but that became awkward and the `specification` repository was proposed as part of [opentracing.io#144](https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing.io/issues/144).

## Current Status

This repository is just getting off the ground. In the future it will house some `.yaml` files (or their moral equivalents) that document various constants shared across repos, and it will definitely be the place to discuss larger OT matters via Github Issues.
